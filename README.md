# Learning Algorithms
## How to Build
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is the build tool being used. Currently using version 3.6.3.

`mvn compile` can be used to compile the source code.  
`mvn test` compiles the source and test code, and runs the tests.   
`mvn package` creates an executable jar that can be found in the `target` folder.   
`java -jar target/algorithms-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` will execute the jar.
